Additionally, this unit deals 2x damage to dark element enemies. Hollow Resonance For every unique time based status effect affecting an enemy on the map, this unit gains a stack of \\'Hollow Resonance\\' (max 3 stacks). When this unit reaches the maximum amount of stacks, he nukes all enemies on the map for 4 times his attack and applying paralysis with his attack stat (140 second global cooldown). Spiritual Union Any time an enemy in this unit's range has paralysis applied to them, they gain tremor as well as tether, unless both of these status effects are already applied, in which case paralysis will apply as normal (if possible) and apply a stack of shock.   Shock: This status effect applies a stack on hit, and deals 5% damage (of the first stacks tower) per stack every 5 seconds. This status effect lasts for 5 seconds. Additionally it goes from 5% to 10% if paralysis is applied.
